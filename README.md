# ProcessWire ImageExtra

This module allows you to add additional informations to an image (for example: title, description, link, orientation and any field you may need).

Some time ago I developed a module ([FieldtypeImageExtra](https://github.com/justonestep/processwire-fieldtypeimageextra)) 
which extends Fieldtype Image with the ability to add custom fields to an image.
This worked well but it had a somehow restricted applicability and did not meet all of our needs.
There of course are other useful image modules like [CroppableImage](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/8709-croppableimage/) or 
[ImageFocusArea](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/8079-imagefocusarea/),
but up to now there was no possibility to combine image cropping with custom fields support.
So you had to decide whether to add image cropping or the possibility to add custom fields because each of those modules sets up their own field type 
(and input type) which cannot be combined.

The new module ImageExtra allows you to have both functionalities.

For more informations have a look at [this documentation](http://www.kf-interactive.com/blog/adding-custom-fields-for-images-in-processwire/).
